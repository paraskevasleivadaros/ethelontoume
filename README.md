## 🚀 Deploy Your Own

### How We Got Started
The project was initially created using the [Docusaurus CLI](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/installation#scaffold-project-website):

```shell
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

It was then adapted and extended to reflect the content and visual identity of **ethelontoume.gr**.
